# "Rusty" Lisp

This is a toy implementation of an S-expression parser using Rust. (I've not in fact used Lisp (so my Lisp is very rusty indeed (as is my Rust, for that matter), not that this matters).)

## How to play
0. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
1. ```cargo run``` (Cargo compiles for you)
